# Invoice Additional Documents Auto-Inclusion in Distribution

## 📋 **Overview**

This document outlines the enhanced implementation that automatically includes and manages additional documents attached to invoices when they are distributed, ensuring complete document tracking and status synchronization.

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

### **Before Implementation:**

-   ❌ **Invoices could be distributed without their attached additional documents**
-   ❌ **Additional documents remained at origin location** when invoices were moved
-   ❌ **No automatic status synchronization** between invoices and their supporting documents
-   ❌ **Manual tracking required** to ensure complete document sets were distributed together

### **After Implementation:**

-   ✅ **Automatic inclusion** of attached additional documents when invoices are distributed
-   ✅ **Complete status synchronization** between invoices and their supporting documents
-   ✅ **Automatic location updates** for both invoices and attached documents
-   ✅ **Seamless user experience** - no need to manually select attached documents

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Enhanced Document Attachment**

#### **New Method: `attachInvoiceAdditionalDocuments()`**

```php
/**
 * Automatically attach additional documents that are linked to distributed invoices
 * This ensures that when invoices are distributed, their supporting documents are also included
 */
private function attachInvoiceAdditionalDocuments(Distribution $distribution, array $invoiceIds): void
{
    foreach ($invoiceIds as $invoiceId) {
        $invoice = Invoice::find($invoiceId);
        if ($invoice && $invoice->additionalDocuments()->count() > 0) {
            foreach ($invoice->additionalDocuments as $additionalDocument) {
                // Only attach if not already attached to this distribution
                $existingAttachment = DistributionDocument::where('distribution_id', $distribution->id)
                    ->where('document_type', AdditionalDocument::class)
                    ->where('document_id', $additionalDocument->id)
                    ->first();

                if (!$existingAttachment) {
                    DistributionDocument::create([
                        'distribution_id' => $distribution->id,
                        'document_type' => AdditionalDocument::class,
                        'document_id' => $additionalDocument->id
                    ]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Integration in Store Method:**

```php
// Attach documents to distribution
$this->attachDocuments($distribution, $request->document_type, $request->document_ids);

// If distributing invoices, also automatically include any attached additional documents
if ($request->document_type === 'invoice') {
    $this->attachInvoiceAdditionalDocuments($distribution, $request->document_ids);
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Status Synchronization**

#### **Updated `updateDocumentDistributionStatuses()` Method:**

```php
private function updateDocumentDistributionStatuses(Distribution $distribution, string $status): void
{
    foreach ($distribution->documents as $distributionDocument) {
        if ($distributionDocument->document_type === Invoice::class) {
            // Update invoice status
            Invoice::where('id', $distributionDocument->document_id)
                ->update(['distribution_status' => $status]);

            // Also update status of any additional documents attached to this invoice
            $invoice = Invoice::find($distributionDocument->document_id);
            if ($invoice && $invoice->additionalDocuments()->count() > 0) {
                $invoice->additionalDocuments()->update(['distribution_status' => $status]);
            }
        } elseif ($distributionDocument->document_type === AdditionalDocument::class) {
            AdditionalDocument::where('id', $distributionDocument->document_id)
                ->update(['distribution_status' => $status]);
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Updated `updateDocumentLocations()` Method:**

```php
private function updateDocumentLocations(Distribution $distribution): void
{
    $destinationLocationCode = $distribution->destinationDepartment->location_code;

    foreach ($distribution->documents as $distributionDocument) {
        if ($distributionDocument->document_type === Invoice::class) {
            // Update invoice location
            Invoice::where('id', $distributionDocument->document_id)
                ->update(['cur_loc' => $destinationLocationCode]);

            // Also update location of any additional documents attached to this invoice
            $invoice = Invoice::find($distributionDocument->document_id);
            if ($invoice && $invoice->additionalDocuments()->count() > 0) {
                $invoice->additionalDocuments()->update(['cur_loc' => $destinationLocationCode]);
            }
        } elseif ($distributionDocument->document_type === AdditionalDocument::class) {
            AdditionalDocument::where('id', $distributionDocument->document_id)
                ->update(['cur_loc' => $destinationLocationCode]);
        }
    }
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Invoice with Attached Documents**

1. **Create Invoice A** with 3 attached additional documents
2. **Create Distribution** selecting only Invoice A
3. **Result**: ✅ Distribution automatically includes Invoice A + 3 additional documents
4. **Send Distribution**: All 4 documents become `in_transit`
5. **Receive Distribution**: All 4 documents become `distributed`
6. **Complete Distribution**: All 4 documents confirmed as `distributed`

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Invoices with Attachments**

1. **Create Distribution** with Invoice A (2 attachments) + Invoice B (1 attachment)
2. **Result**: ✅ Distribution includes 2 invoices + 3 additional documents
3. **Status Updates**: All 5 documents synchronized through entire workflow

### **Scenario 3: Mixed Document Types**

1. **Create Distribution** with Invoice A (2 attachments) + 1 standalone additional document
2. **Result**: ✅ Distribution includes 1 invoice + 3 additional documents (2 attached + 1 standalone)
3. **All documents tracked together** through the distribution lifecycle

## 📊 **Database Impact**

### **Distribution Documents Table:**

```sql
-- Example: Distribution with 1 invoice that has 2 attached documents
distribution_id | document_type           | document_id
1              | App\Models\Invoice      | 100
1              | App\Models\AdditionalDocument | 201
1              | App\Models\AdditionalDocument | 202
```

### **Status Synchronization:**

```sql
-- When distribution status changes to 'in_transit'
UPDATE invoices SET distribution_status = 'in_transit' WHERE id = 100;
UPDATE additional_documents SET distribution_status = 'in_transit' WHERE id IN (201, 202);
```

### **Location Synchronization:**

```sql
-- When distribution is received
UPDATE invoices SET cur_loc = 'DEST_DEPT' WHERE id = 100;
UPDATE additional_documents SET cur_loc = 'DEST_DEPT' WHERE id IN (201, 202);
```

## 🚀 **Implementation Details**

### **1. Automatic Detection**

-   **Invoice selection triggers** automatic additional document inclusion
-   **Relationship queries** identify all attached documents
-   **Duplicate prevention** ensures documents aren't attached multiple times

### **2. Performance Considerations**

-   **Eager loading** of additional documents relationships
-   **Batch updates** for status and location changes
-   **Indexed queries** for fast relationship lookups

### **3. Error Handling**

-   **Graceful fallback** if additional documents can't be loaded
-   **Transaction safety** ensures all-or-nothing updates
-   **Logging** for debugging and audit purposes
