# DDS Laravel Architecture Documentation

## 🏗️ **System Overview**

The DDS (Document Distribution System) is a comprehensive Laravel 11+ application designed for managing document workflows across multiple departments. The system handles invoices, additional documents, and their distribution through a secure, role-based workflow.

## 🎨 **UI/UX Architecture Patterns**

### **Document Location Change Validation System** ✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-10-09)

**Pattern**: Multi-layer validation system to prevent manual location changes for documents with distribution history

**Business Rule**: Once a document (invoice or additional document) enters the distribution workflow, its location can ONLY be changed through the distribution process itself, not through manual editing.

**Implementation**:

-   **Model Layer**: Added `canChangeLocationManually()` method to both `AdditionalDocument` and `Invoice` models
-   **Controller Validation**: Pre-validation checks in update methods before processing form data
-   **View Layer**: Disabled location dropdown with visual indicators when document has distribution history
-   **Data Integrity**: Hidden input preserves original location value when field is disabled

**Technical Architecture**:

```
Location Change Validation System
├── Model Layer (Business Logic)
│   ├── AdditionalDocument::canChangeLocationManually()
│   │   └── Returns !hasBeenDistributed()
│   ├── Invoice::canChangeLocationManually()
│   │   └── Returns !hasBeenDistributed()
│   ├── hasBeenDistributed()
│   │   └── Checks if distributions()->exists()
│   └── distributions() - Relationship to distribution history
├── Controller Layer (Backend Validation)
│   ├── AdditionalDocumentController::update()
│   │   ├── Checks if cur_loc is being changed
│   │   ├── Validates canChangeLocationManually()
│   │   └── Returns error if location change attempted on distributed document
│   └── InvoiceController::update()
│       ├── Same validation logic as AdditionalDocumentController
│       └── Works alongside existing role-based access control
└── View Layer (Frontend Prevention)
    ├── additional_documents/edit.blade.php
    │   ├── @php checks: hasBeenDistributed() & canChangeLocationManually()
    │   ├── Disabled dropdown when document has distributions
    │   ├── Hidden input to preserve location value
    │   └── Warning message with lock icon
    └── invoices/edit.blade.php
        ├── Combined distribution + role-based disabling logic
        ├── Disabled when: has distributions OR insufficient role
        └── Context-specific warning messages
```

**Validation Flow**:

```php
// 1. Model Method - Business Logic
public function canChangeLocationManually(): bool
{
    return !$this->hasBeenDistributed();
}

// 2. Controller Validation - Pre-check before update
if ($request->has('cur_loc') && $request->cur_loc !== $additionalDocument->cur_loc) {
    if (!$additionalDocument->canChangeLocationManually()) {
        return redirect()->back()
            ->withErrors([
                'cur_loc' => 'Cannot change location manually. This document has distribution history.
                              Location can only be changed through the distribution process.'
            ])
            ->withInput();
    }
}

// 3. View Layer - Frontend Prevention
@php
    $hasDistributions = $additionalDocument->hasBeenDistributed();
    $canChangeLocation = $additionalDocument->canChangeLocationManually();
@endphp

<select id="cur_loc" name="cur_loc" {{ !$canChangeLocation ? 'disabled' : '' }}>
    <!-- options -->
</select>

@if (!$canChangeLocation)
    <input type="hidden" name="cur_loc" value="{{ $additionalDocument->cur_loc }}">
    <small class="text-warning">
        <i class="fas fa-lock"></i> Location locked - This document has distribution history.
    </small>
@endif
```

**Key Features**:

-   **Multi-Layer Security**: Frontend disabled + Backend validation + Database consistency
-   **Bypass Prevention**: Even if frontend is circumvented, backend blocks the change
-   **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear explanations with lock icons for locked fields
-   **Data Preservation**: Hidden input ensures original location is submitted when disabled
-   **Audit Trail**: Location changes only through documented distribution process
-   **Consistent Logic**: Same validation pattern across invoices and additional documents

**Security Benefits**:

-   ✅ **Data Integrity**: Distribution workflow is single source of truth for location tracking
-   ✅ **Audit Compliance**: All location changes are tracked through distribution system
-   ✅ **Workflow Enforcement**: Prevents circumvention of business process
-   ✅ **Historical Accuracy**: Maintains accurate distribution history and location timeline
-   ✅ **User Education**: Warning messages explain why field is locked

**Test Scenarios**:

| Scenario             | Document ID     | Has Distributions | Location Field   | Backend    | Result                               |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Edit with history    | 222 (251006202) | ✅ Yes (1)        | 🔒 Disabled      | ❌ Blocked | Location unchanged                   |
| Edit without history | 129 (251006149) | ❌ No (0)         | ✅ Enabled       | ✅ Allowed | Location changed successfully        |
| Bypass attempt       | 222 (251006202) | ✅ Yes (1)        | 🕵️ Forced via JS | ❌ Blocked | Validation error, location unchanged |

**Code Examples**:

```php
// Controller Sorting Logic (InvoiceController.php)
$invoices = $query->get()->sortByDesc(function ($invoice) {
    if ($invoice->distribution_status === 'available' && !$invoice->hasBeenDistributed()) {
        $dateToUse = $invoice->receive_date;
    } else {
        $dateToUse = $invoice->current_location_arrival_date;
    }
    return $dateToUse ? $dateToUse->diffInDays(now()) : 0;
})->values();

// Age Categorization (Invoice Model)
public function getCurrentLocationAgeCategoryAttribute()
{
    $days = $this->days_in_current_location;

    if ($days <= 7) return '0-7_days';
    elseif ($days <= 14) return '8-14_days';

### **Invoice Edit and Update System Architecture**

**Pattern**: Comprehensive invoice editing with dual-field amount system and proper field synchronization

**Implementation**:

-   **Edit Page Access**: Route-based access to `/invoices/{id}/edit` with proper authorization
-   **Form Pre-population**: Automatic form loading with existing invoice data
-   **Dual-Field Amount System**: `amount_display` (user input) and hidden `amount` (submission)
-   **Field Synchronization**: `formatNumber()` function ensures proper field sync
-   **Validation**: `UniqueInvoicePerSupplier` rule with proper exclusion logic
-   **AJAX Submission**: Form submission with loading states and notifications
-   **Database Updates**: Proper field persistence with timestamp tracking

**Technical Architecture**:

```php
// Invoice Edit Controller Structure
InvoiceController
├── edit(Invoice $invoice) → Edit form with pre-populated data
├── update(Request $request, Invoice $invoice) → Process form updates
└── validation rules → UniqueInvoicePerSupplier, required fields, etc.
```

**Form Field Architecture**:

```javascript
// Dual-Field Amount System
Amount Field Structure
├── amount_display (visible input) → User interaction
├── amount (hidden input) → Form submission
└── formatNumber() → Synchronization function
```

**Validation Architecture**:

```php
// Custom Validation Rule
UniqueInvoicePerSupplier
├── validate() → Check for duplicate invoice numbers per supplier
├── excludeId → Exclude current invoice from duplicate check
└── setData() → Access form data for validation
```

**AJAX Submission Flow**:

```javascript
// Form Submission Architecture
Edit Form Submission
├── Form Validation → Client-side validation
├── AJAX Request → Submit form data
├── Loading States → Show progress indicators
├── Success Handling → Display notifications
├── Database Update → Persist changes
└── Redirect → Return to invoices list
```

**Key Technical Patterns**:

-   **Field Synchronization**: Explicit `formatNumber()` calls ensure data integrity
-   **Validation Exclusion**: Current invoice excluded from duplicate checks
-   **Loading States**: Proper user feedback during form submission
-   **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error display
-   **Database Persistence**: All field updates properly tracked with timestamps

**Files Involved**:

-   `resources/views/invoices/edit.blade.php` - Edit form and JavaScript functionality
-   `app/Http/Controllers/InvoiceController.php` - Update method and validation
-   `app/Rules/UniqueInvoicePerSupplier.php` - Custom validation rule
-   `routes/invoice.php` - Resource routes for edit/update

        "#receive_date",
        "#cur_loc",
        "#remarks",
        "#attachment",
        "#vendor_code",
    ];

    let filled = 0;
    let total = requiredFields.length;

    requiredFields.forEach(function (field) {
        const element = $(field);
        if (element.length && element.val() && element.val().trim() !== "") {
            filled++;
        }
    });

    var percentage = total > 0 ? Math.round((filled / total) * 100) : 0;

    // Update progress bar with standard Bootstrap classes
    $("#form-progress-bar")
        .css("width", percentage + "%")
        .attr("aria-valuenow", percentage)
        .text(percentage + "%")
        .removeClass("bg-danger bg-warning bg-success")
        .addClass(
            percentage >= 100
                ? "bg-success"
                : percentage >= 75
                ? "bg-info"
                : percentage >= 50
                ? "bg-warning"
                : "bg-danger"
        );

-   **DataTables Integration**: Each page has its own DataTable initialization without tab switching conflicts
-   **Navigation Cards**: Visual navigation between related pages with active state indicators
-   **Permission-Based Access**: Role-based visibility and functionality control

**Technical Architecture**:

```php
// Controller Structure
SapUpdateController
├── index() → Dashboard view
├── withoutSapPage() → Without SAP Doc view
├── withSapPage() → With SAP Doc view
├── dashboard() → Dashboard data API
├── withoutSap() → Without SAP Doc DataTables API
├── withSap() → With SAP Doc DataTables API
├── updateSapDoc() → Update SAP document number
└── validateSapDoc() → Real-time validation API
```

**Route Structure**:

```php
Route::prefix('sap-update')->name('sap-update.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', [SapUpdateController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
    Route::get('/without-sap', [SapUpdateController::class, 'withoutSapPage'])->name('without-sap-page');
    Route::get('/with-sap', [SapUpdateController::class, 'withSapPage'])->name('with-sap-page');
    Route::get('/dashboard-data', [SapUpdateController::class, 'dashboard'])->name('dashboard-data');
    Route::get('/without-sap-data', [SapUpdateController::class, 'withoutSap'])->name('without-sap');
    Route::get('/with-sap-data', [SapUpdateController::class, 'withSap'])->name('with-sap');
    Route::put('/{invoice}/update-sap-doc', [SapUpdateController::class, 'updateSapDoc'])->name('update-sap-doc');
    Route::post('/validate-sap-doc', [SapUpdateController::class, 'validateSapDoc'])->name('validate-sap-doc');
});
```

**Database Architecture**:

```sql
-- Unique constraint allowing multiple NULL values
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD CONSTRAINT unique_sap_doc_non_null
UNIQUE (sap_doc) WHERE sap_doc IS NOT NULL;

-- Department-Invoice relationship
Department (location_code) ←→ Invoice (cur_loc)
```

**View Architecture**:

```
resources/views/invoices/sap-update/
├── dashboard.blade.php → Main dashboard with metrics and charts
├── without-sap.blade.php → Invoices without SAP document numbers
└── with-sap.blade.php → Invoices with SAP document numbers
```

**Key Design Decisions**:

-   **Standalone Pages**: Avoided tab-based interface due to DataTables rendering issues in hidden tabs
-   **Individual Updates**: No bulk operations to maintain SAP document uniqueness
-   **Real-time Validation**: AJAX validation for SAP document uniqueness
-   **Dashboard Integration**: Department-wise completion summary in main dashboard
-   **Permission Control**: `view-sap-update` permission for role-based access

**Benefits**:

-   **Reliable Rendering**: DataTables work correctly without tab switching conflicts
-   **Better Performance**: Each page loads only necessary data and scripts
-   **Clear Navigation**: Visual indicators show current page and related functions
-   **Maintainable Code**: Separate files for each functionality area
-   **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new SAP-related features

### **Global Page Title Alignment System**

**Pattern**: Consistent page title alignment across all pages for professional visual hierarchy

**Implementation**:

-   **Global CSS Solution**: Centralized styling in `layouts/partials/head.blade.php`
-   **Precise Alignment**: 27.5px left padding to match card content exactly
-   **Bootstrap Integration**: Works with existing Bootstrap grid system
-   **Future-Proof**: Applied globally to prevent individual page fixes

**Technical Architecture**:

```css
/* Global page title alignment with content */
.content-header {
    padding-left: 27.5px; /* Matches container-fluid (7.5px) + card-body (20px) */
    padding-right: 7.5px;
}

.content-header .col-sm-6:first-child {
    padding-left: 0; /* Remove default column padding for precise alignment */
}
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:

-   **Bootstrap Defaults**: `.content-header` had `padding: 15px .5rem` (8px left)
-   **Container Padding**: `.container-fluid` had `padding-left: 7.5px`
-   **Card Body Padding**: `.card-body` added additional 20px padding
-   **Total Offset**: 27.5px difference between title and content alignment

**Benefits**:

-   **Visual Consistency**: All pages have properly aligned titles and content
-   **Professional Appearance**: Clean visual hierarchy enhances application credibility
-   **User Experience**: Consistent interface reduces user confusion
-   **Maintainability**: Global solution prevents future alignment issues

### **Layout Structure Standardization**

**Pattern**: Consistent layout structure across all pages for maintainability and user experience

**Implementation**:

-   **Standard Sections**: All pages use `@section('title_page')` and `@section('breadcrumb_title')`
-   **Content Structure**: Consistent `section class="content"` with `container-fluid` wrapper
-   **Breadcrumb Integration**: Proper breadcrumb navigation in standard location
-   **Future Development**: New pages automatically get proper structure

**Standard Layout Template**:

```blade
@extends('layouts.main')

@section('title_page')
    Page Title
@endsection

@section('breadcrumb_title')
    <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a></li>
    <li class="breadcrumb-item active">Current Page</li>
@endsection

@section('content')
    <section class="content">
        <div class="container-fluid">
            {{-- Page content here --}}
        </div>
    </section>
@endsection
```

**Benefits**:

-   **Consistent Structure**: All pages follow same layout pattern

**Implementation**:

-   **Conditional Rendering**: `@can` directive for permission-based component visibility
-   **Consistent Patterns**: Same permission checking across all UI components
-   **User Experience**: Users only see relevant features and actions
-   **Security**: Frontend protection complements backend permission validation

**Technical Implementation**:

```blade
{{-- Permission-based switch visibility --}}
@if (auth()->user()->can('view-all-records'))
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="d-block">Show All Records</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="showAllRecords" data-bootstrap-switch>
    </div>
@endif

{{-- Permission-based button visibility --}}
@if (auth()->user()->can('on-the-fly-addoc-feature'))
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-success" id="create-doc-btn">
        <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> Create New Document
    </button>
@endif
```

**Benefits**:

    const showAll = $(this).is(':checked');
    table.ajax.reload();
});

// Controller parameter handling
$query->when($request->get('show_all_records') === 'true', function ($query) {
    return $query->whereNotNull('cur_loc');
});
```

**Benefits**:

-   **Flexible Filtering**: Users can toggle between different data views
-   **Real-time Updates**: Instant data refresh without page reload
-   **Consistent Interface**: Same functionality across different pages

## 🔄 **Core Workflows**

### **Authentication Flow (Email or Username)**

The system supports logging in using either email or username with a single `login` field. The backend resolves the credential field dynamically and requires `is_active = true`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant B as Browser (Login Form)
    participant A as App (LoginController)
    participant DB as Database

    U->>B: Enter login (email or username) + password
    B->>A: POST /login { login, password }
    A->>A: Detect field (email vs username)
    A->>DB: Auth::attempt({ field: value, password, is_active: true })
    alt Success
        A->>B: 302 Redirect /dashboard
    else Failure
        A->>B: 422 Error on 'login'
    end
```

Implementation references:

-   Controller: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`
-   View: `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`
-   Tests: `tests/Feature/LoginTest.php`
-   Decision: `docs/decisions.md` (2025-09-06)

#### **Username Uniqueness Validation Pattern** (2025-10-01)

The system enforces username uniqueness while supporting NULL values for email-only users.

**Database Schema**:

```php
// users table
Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('username')->nullable()->unique()->change();
});
```

**Key Characteristics**:

-   **Nullable Unique Constraint**: MySQL allows multiple NULL values while enforcing uniqueness on non-NULL values
-   **Database-Level Integrity**: Constraint prevents duplicates even with direct database access
-   **Application-Level Validation**: User-friendly error messages for duplicate username attempts

**Validation Rules**:

```php
// User Creation (UserController::store)
'username' => ['nullable', 'string', 'max:255', 'unique:users']

// User Update (UserController::update)
'username' => ['nullable', 'string', 'max:255', 'unique:users,username,' . $user->id]
```

**Security Pattern**:

-   ✅ Prevents username impersonation
-   ✅ Eliminates login ambiguity
-   ✅ Multi-layer validation (database + application)
-   ✅ Maintains email-only login flexibility

**Implementation References**:

-   Migration: `database/migrations/2025_10_01_060319_add_unique_constraint_to_username_in_users_table.php`
-   Controller: `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserController.php`
-   Decision: `docs/decisions.md` (2025-10-01)

### **External API System**

The system provides secure external API access for invoice data with comprehensive security and user accountability:

**API Architecture**:

-   **Authentication**: API key-based authentication using `DDS_API_KEY` environment variable
-   **Rate Limiting**: Multi-tier rate limiting (hourly: 100, minute: 20, daily: 1000 requests)
-   **Security Middleware**: Custom `ApiKeyMiddleware` and `ApiRateLimitMiddleware` for enterprise-grade security
-   **Data Access**: Read-only access to invoice data with complete user accountability

**API Endpoints**:

-   **General Invoices**: `GET /api/v1/departments/{location_code}/invoices` - All invoices with comprehensive data
-   **Wait-Payment Invoices**: `GET /api/v1/departments/{location_code}/wait-payment-invoices` - Invoices pending payment
-   **Paid Invoices**: `GET /api/v1/departments/{location_code}/paid-invoices` - Invoices with completed payments
-   **Payment Updates**: `PUT /api/v1/invoices/{invoice_id}/payment` - Update payment information
-   **Department Reference**: `GET /api/v1/departments` - Available departments for API consumers

**Data Structure**:

-   **Invoice Fields**: Complete invoice data including `paid_by` field for user accountability
-   **Additional Documents**: Nested document information with proper relationships
-   **Distribution Data**: Latest distribution information to requested department
-   **User Accountability**: `paid_by` field shows user who processed payment
-   **Enhanced Filtering**: Project, supplier, date range, and status filtering capabilities

**Security Features**:

-   **API Key Validation**: Secure header-based authentication
-   **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse with configurable limits
-   **Audit Logging**: Complete request logging with IP tracking and timestamps
-   **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes

### **Distribution Workflow**

```
Draft → Verified by Sender → Sent → Received → Verified by Receiver → Completed
  ↓           ↓              ↓        ↓           ↓                    ↓
Create    Sender Verifies  Send to   Receive    Receiver Verifies   Complete
Distribution  Documents   Destination  Documents   Documents        Distribution
```

**Critical Status Management**:

-   **Document Protection**: Documents become `'in_transit'` when distribution is sent, preventing selection in new distributions
-   **Status Isolation**: Documents in transit are completely isolated from new distribution selection
-   **Workflow Integrity**: Complete audit trail of document movement through distribution lifecycle

**Status Transitions**:

1. **Available** (`distribution_status = 'available'`) → Can be selected for distribution
2. **In Transit** (`distribution_status = 'in_transit'`) → Cannot be selected for new distributions ✅
3. **Distributed** (`distribution_status = 'distributed'`) → Cannot be selected for new distributions ✅
4. **Unaccounted For** (`distribution_status = 'unaccounted_for'`) → Cannot be selected for new distributions ✅

### **On-the-Fly Document Creation Workflow**

**Overview**: Real-time additional document creation within invoice workflows

```
Invoice Create/Edit → Click "Create New Document" → Modal Form → Submit → Auto-Select → Continue Invoice
        ↓                        ↓                    ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓
    Permission Check      Open Bootstrap Modal    Fill Form    AJAX Submit   Add to Selection   Attach to Invoice
```

**Architecture Components**:

-   **Frontend**: Bootstrap modal with comprehensive form validation
-   **Backend**: Dedicated route and controller method with permission validation
-   **Integration**: Seamless embedding in invoice create/edit workflows
-   **UX**: Real-time updates without page refreshes

**Key Technical Decisions**:

1. **Modal Placement**: Positioned outside main form to prevent nested form HTML issues
2. **Permission System**: Both backend (`Auth::user()->can()`) and frontend conditional rendering
3. **Auto-Population**: PO number and location defaults for improved UX
4. **Real-time Integration**: AJAX submission with immediate UI updates

**Data Flow**:

```php
// Frontend: Modal form submission
$.ajax({
    url: '/additional-documents/on-the-fly',
    data: formData,
    success: function(response) {
        // Auto-select created document
        selectedDocs[newDoc.id] = newDoc;
        // Refresh table and update UI
        searchAdditionalDocuments();
```

**Visual Styling System**:

```css
.attached-document-row {
    background-color: #f8f9fa !important;
    border-left: 4px solid #007bff;
}

.attached-document-row:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: #e9ecef !important;
}

.attached-document-row td:first-child {
    padding-left: 30px;
    position: relative;
}

.attached-document-row td:first-child::before {
    content: "↳";
    position: absolute;
    left: 10px;
    color: #007bff;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

**Key Features**:

$invoiceDocuments = $distribution->documents->filter(function ($doc) {
    return $doc->document_type === 'App\Models\Invoice';
});

$additionalDocumentDocuments = $distribution->documents->filter(function ($doc) {
    return $doc->document_type === 'App\Models\AdditionalDocument';
});

// Attached documents grouping
$attachedAdditionalDocs = collect();
foreach ($invoiceDocuments as $invoiceDoc) {
    $invoice = $invoiceDoc->document;
    if ($invoice->additionalDocuments && $invoice->additionalDocuments->count() > 0) {
        // Group attached documents with parent invoice
    }
}

// Standalone documents
$standaloneAdditionalDocs = $additionalDocumentDocuments->filter(function ($doc) use ($attachedAdditionalDocs) {
    return !$attachedAdditionalDocs->contains('distribution_doc.id', $doc->id);
});
```

**User Experience Benefits**:

-   **Visual Clarity**: Clear distinction between invoices and attached documents
-   **Logical Organization**: Related documents grouped together for easier understanding
-   **Workflow Efficiency**: Users can quickly identify and manage document relationships
-   **Professional Appearance**: Modern, clean interface design with proper visual hierarchy

'attachment' => 'nullable|file|mimes:pdf,doc,docx,jpg,jpeg,png|max:51200'
```

**Frontend Validation (JavaScript)**:

```javascript
// Client-side file size validation
var maxPerFile = 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB
var maxSize = 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB

// Real-time validation on file selection
$("#files").on("change", function () {
    var files = this.files;
    for (var i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
        if (files[i].size > maxPerFile) {
            alert("Each file must be 50MB or less.");

}
```

**Permission System**:

-   **Permission**: `reset-document-status` required for all operations
-   **Role Assignment**: Limited to admin and superadmin roles
-   **Access Control**: Middleware-based protection at route level
-   **Frontend Control**: Conditional rendering using `@can('reset-document-status')`

**Data Relationships**:

```php
// Invoice eager loading
->with(['supplier', 'invoiceProjectInfo', 'creator.department'])

// Additional Document eager loading
->with(['type', 'creator.department'])

// Project relationship access
$invoice->invoiceProjectInfo->code ?? $invoice->invoice_project ?? 'N/A'
```

**Status Management Logic**:

1. **Individual Operations**: Full status flexibility (any → any)
2. **Bulk Operations**: Safety-restricted (`unaccounted_for` → `available` only)
3. **Department Filtering**: Non-admin users see only their department documents
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete tracking via DistributionHistory model

**Audit Trail Integration**:

```php
DistributionHistory::create([
    'distribution_id' => null, // Not tied to specific distribution
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'action' => 'status_reset',
    'metadata' => [
        'document_type' => get_class($document),
        'document_id' => $document->id,
        'old_status' => $oldStatus,
        'new_status' => $newStatus,
        'reason' => $reason,
        'operation_type' => $operationType,
        'timestamp' => now()->toISOString()
    ],
    'action_performed_at' => now()
]);
```

**Critical Implementation**:

```php
private function updateDocumentDistributionStatuses(Distribution $distribution, string $status): void
{
    foreach ($distribution->documents as $distributionDocument) {
        if ($distributionDocument->document_type === Invoice::class) {
            if ($status === 'in_transit') {
                // ✅ When SENT: Update ALL documents to 'in_transit' (prevent selection in new distributions)
                Invoice::where('id', $distributionDocument->document_id)
                    ->update(['distribution_status' => $status]);

                // Also update attached additional documents
                $invoice->additionalDocuments()->update(['distribution_status' => $status]);
            } elseif ($status === 'distributed') {
                // ✅ When RECEIVED: Only update verified documents
                if ($distributionDocument->receiver_verification_status === 'verified') {
                    // Update status...
                }
            }
        }
        // Similar logic for AdditionalDocument...
    }
}
```

**Business Logic Flow**:

-   **When SENT**: ALL documents become `'in_transit'` (preventing selection in new distributions)
-   **When RECEIVED**: Only `'verified'` documents become `'distributed'`
-   **Missing/Damaged**: Keep original status for audit trail integrity

**Layout Architecture**:

-   **View Extension**: Uses `layouts.main` for consistent application structure
-   **Section Organization**: Proper `@section('title_page')`, `@section('breadcrumb_title')`, `@section('content')`
-   **Content Structure**: `<section class="content">` with `<div class="container-fluid">` wrapper
-   **Script Organization**: JavaScript organized in `@section('scripts')` with proper DataTables integration

**Database Architecture**:

-   **Migration Strategy**: Created migration to make `distribution_id` nullable in `distribution_histories` table
-   **Constraint Management**: Proper foreign key constraints with nullable support for standalone operations
-   **Audit Trail**: Complete status change tracking with required fields (`action`, `action_type`, `metadata`)

**Audit Logging Architecture**:

```php
// Complete audit trail creation
DistributionHistory::create([
    'distribution_id' => null, // Nullable for standalone operations
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'action' => 'status_reset',
    'action_type' => 'status_management', // Required field for categorization
    'metadata' => [
        'document_type' => get_class($document),
        'document_id' => $document->id,
        'old_status' => $oldStatus,
        'new_status' => $newStatus,
        'reason' => $reason,
        'operation_type' => $operationType,
        'timestamp' => now()->toISOString()
    ],
    'action_performed_at' => now()
]);
```

## 🔐 **Security & Permissions**

### **Role-Based Access Control**

**Permission Checking Pattern**:

```php
// Consistent pattern used throughout the codebase
if (!array_intersect($user->roles->pluck('name')->toArray(), ['superadmin', 'admin'])) {
    // Regular user restrictions
    $query->where('destination_department_id', $user->department->id)
          ->where('status', 'sent');
}
```

**Benefits**:

-   **Performance**: Uses PHP array operations instead of method calls
-   **Consistency**: Same pattern across all permission checks
-   **Maintainability**: Easy to understand and modify permission logic

### **Department Isolation**

**Access Control**:

-   **Regular Users**: Can only see distributions related to their department
-   **Admin/Superadmin**: Can access all distributions across departments
-   **Data Filtering**: All queries respect user's department location

## 🗄️ **Database Architecture**

### **Database Overview**

**Current Database Status**:

-   **Database Name**: `dds_laravel`
-   **Total Tables**: 101 tables
-   **Database Size**: 30.36 MB
-   **Connection**: MySQL 9.2.0 on 127.0.0.1:3306
-   **Access Methods**: Laravel Eloquent, MCP MySQL (configuration issues), Direct SQL

### **Core Tables**

**Distributions**:

-   `distributions`: Main distribution records with workflow status
-   `distribution_documents`: Polymorphic pivot table linking documents to distributions
-   `distribution_histories`: Complete audit trail of all workflow actions

**Documents**:

-   `invoices`: Financial documents with supplier and project information
-   `additional_documents`: Supporting documents linked to invoices
-   `distribution_status` enum: `available`, `in_transit`, `distributed`, `unaccounted_for`

**Document Status Management**:

-   `DocumentStatusController`: Admin interface for status management and reset operations
-   `reset-document-status` permission: Controls access to status management features
-   `DistributionHistory`: Audit trail for all status changes with reason tracking
-   **View Architecture**: Proper layout structure with `layouts.main` extension and section organization

**Users & Departments**:

-   `users`: System users with role assignments and project associations
-   `departments`: Department locations with location codes
-   `roles`: User roles (superadmin, admin, user)
-   `projects`: Project definitions with unique codes

### **User-Project Relationship**

**Users Table Structure**:

```sql
users: id, name, nik, username, email, password, project, department_id, is_active, timestamps
```

**Projects Table Structure**:

```sql
projects: id, code, owner, location, is_active, timestamps
```

**Relationship Pattern**:

-   **Users.project** → **Projects.code** (many-to-one relationship)
-   **Project Codes**: Unique identifiers like '000H' for specific projects
-   **Department Association**: Users also belong to departments via `department_id`

**Query Pattern for Project Users**:

```sql
SELECT u.name, u.email, u.project, d.name as department_name
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN departments d ON u.department_id = d.id
WHERE u.project = '000H'
```

**Laravel Model Relationships**:

```php
// User model relationship
public function projectInfo()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Project::class, 'project', 'code');
}

// Project model
class Project extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['code', 'owner', 'location', 'is_active'];
}
```

### **Key Relationships**

**Polymorphic Document Linking**:

```php
// Distribution can contain both invoices and additional documents
$distribution->documents() // Returns DistributionDocument collection
$distribution->invoices() // Returns Invoice collection
$distribution->additionalDocuments() // Returns AdditionalDocument collection
```

**Document Status Synchronization**:

-   **Primary Documents**: Invoices and additional documents maintain `distribution_status`
-   **Related Documents**: Additional documents attached to invoices are automatically synchronized
-   **Status Isolation**: Documents in transit cannot be selected for new distributions

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**

### **Query Optimization**

**Eager Loading**:

```php
// Prevent N+1 queries in distribution views
$distribution->load(['documents.document', 'originDepartment', 'destinationDepartment']);
```

**Scope Usage**:

```php
// Efficient filtering for available documents
Invoice::availableForDistribution()->get();
AdditionalDocument::availableForDistribution()->get();
```

### **Permission Checking**

**Array Operations**:

```php
// Fast permission validation using PHP array operations
array_intersect($user->roles->pluck('name')->toArray(), ['superadmin', 'admin'])
```
