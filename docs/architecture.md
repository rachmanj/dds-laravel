Purpose: Technical reference for understanding system design and development patterns
Last Updated: 2025-08-09

## Architecture Documentation Guidelines

### Document Purpose

This document describes the CURRENT WORKING STATE of the application architecture. It serves as:

-   Technical reference for understanding how the system currently works
-   Onboarding guide for new developers
-   Design pattern documentation for consistent development
-   Schema and data flow documentation reflecting actual implementation

### What TO Include

-   **Current Technology Stack**: Technologies actually in use
-   **Working Components**: Components that are implemented and functional
-   **Actual Database Schema**: Tables, fields, and relationships as they exist
-   **Implemented Data Flows**: How data actually moves through the system
-   **Working API Endpoints**: Routes that are active and functional
-   **Deployment Patterns**: How the system is actually deployed
-   **Security Measures**: Security implementations that are active

### What NOT to Include

-   **Issues or Bugs**: These belong in `MEMORY.md` with technical debt entries
-   **Limitations or Problems**: Document what IS working, not what isn't
-   **Future Plans**: Enhancement ideas belong in `backlog.md`
-   **Deprecated Features**: Remove outdated information rather than marking as deprecated
-   **Wishlist Items**: Planned features that aren't implemented yet

### Update Guidelines

-   **Reflect Reality**: Always document the actual current state, not intended state
-   **Schema Notes**: When database schema has unused fields, note them factually
-   **Cross-Reference**: Link to other docs when appropriate, but don't duplicate content

### For AI Coding Agents

-   **Investigate Before Updating**: Use codebase search to verify current implementation
-   **Move Issues to Memory**: If you discover problems, document them in `MEMORY.md`
-   **Factual Documentation**: Describe what exists, not what should exist

# System Architecture

## Overview

The DDS Laravel system is a comprehensive document management and invoice processing platform built with Laravel 10, featuring role-based access control, file management, and integrated notification systems.

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

-   **Laravel Sanctum**: API authentication
-   **Spatie Laravel Permission**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
-   **User Roles**: superadmin, admin, user with department-based restrictions

### 2. Database Architecture

-   **Primary Database**: MySQL (`dds_backend`)
-   **Key Tables**: users, departments, invoices, suppliers, invoice_types, projects, additional_documents, distributions
-   **Relationships**: Complex many-to-many relationships with pivot tables for document distribution

### 3. File Management System

-   **Storage**: Laravel Storage with local filesystem
-   **File Types**: PDFs, images, documents
-   **Attachments**: Polymorphic relationships for multiple document types

## Invoices Management System

### Current Implementation Status

-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Core CRUD operations with proper validation
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Role-based access control and location restrictions
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Comprehensive toastr notification system
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: AJAX form submission for create/edit operations
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: SweetAlert2 integration for delete confirmations
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: DataTables integration with server-side processing
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Edit page navigation (dedicated edit pages instead of modals)
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Delete functionality with proper AJAX handling and user feedback

### Technical Architecture

```
Invoices Management Flow:
1. User Access Control ‚Üí Department Location Validation
2. Form Submission ‚Üí AJAX Processing ‚Üí Database Validation
3. Real-time Validation ‚Üí Composite Unique Constraint (supplier_id + invoice_number)
4. User Feedback ‚Üí Toastr Notifications + SweetAlert2 Confirmations
5. Data Persistence ‚Üí Optimized Database Schema with Proper Indexes
```

### Validation System Architecture

#### **Invoice Number Duplication Prevention**

-   **Database Level**: Composite unique constraint on `(supplier_id, invoice_number)`
-   **Application Level**: Custom validation rule `UniqueInvoicePerSupplier`
-   **Frontend Level**: Real-time AJAX validation with debounced input
-   **API Endpoint**: `/invoices/validate-invoice-number` for instant feedback

#### **Validation Flow**

```
User Input ‚Üí Frontend Validation ‚Üí AJAX Request ‚Üí Backend Validation ‚Üí Database Check ‚Üí Response ‚Üí UI Update
```

#### **Key Benefits**

-   **Business Logic**: Different suppliers can use same invoice numbers
-   **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate invoices per supplier
-   **User Experience**: Instant feedback without form submission
-   **Performance**: Debounced validation (500ms delay) + database indexes

### Notification System Architecture

-   **Toastr**: Primary notification system for all user feedback
    -   Success messages, error handling, validation feedback
    -   Non-blocking, auto-dismissing notifications
    -   Consistent positioning and styling across all views
    -   Session message integration for page loads
    -   AJAX response feedback for real-time operations
-   **SweetAlert2**: Critical confirmations only (delete operations)
    -   Modal-style confirmations for destructive actions
    -   Enhanced user experience for important decisions
    -   Consistent styling with AdminLTE theme

### AJAX Integration Patterns

-   **Form Submission**: AJAX with FormData for file uploads
-   **Response Handling**: JSON responses for AJAX, redirects for regular requests
-   **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation error display
-   **Loading States**: User feedback during operations
-   **Delete Operations**: SweetAlert2 confirmation followed by AJAX DELETE request
-   **DataTable Integration**: Proper reload after operations without pagination reset

### User Interface Architecture

-   **Edit Operations**: Direct navigation to dedicated edit pages
    -   Consistent form experience with create pages
    -   Proper validation and error handling
    -   File upload support for attachments
