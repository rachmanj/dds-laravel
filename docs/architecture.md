Last Updated: 2025-08-11

## Architecture Documentation Guidelines

### Document Purpose

This document describes the CURRENT WORKING STATE of the application architecture. It serves as:

-   Technical reference for understanding how the system currently works
-   Onboarding guide for new developers
-   Design pattern documentation for consistent development
-   Schema and data flow documentation reflecting actual implementation

### What TO Include

-   **Current Technology Stack**: Technologies actually in use
-   **Working Components**: Components that are implemented and functional
-   **Actual Database Schema**: Tables, fields, and relationships as they exist
-   **Implemented Data Flows**: How data actually moves through the system
-   **Working API Endpoints**: Routes that are active and functional
-   **Deployment Patterns**: How the system is actually deployed
-   **Security Measures**: Security implementations that are active

### What NOT to Include

-   **Issues or Bugs**: These belong in `MEMORY.md` with technical debt entries
-   **Limitations or Problems**: Document what IS working, not what isn't
-   **Future Plans**: Enhancement ideas belong in `backlog.md`
-   **Deprecated Features**: Remove outdated information rather than marking as deprecated
-   **Wishlist Items**: Planned features that aren't implemented yet

### Update Guidelines

-   **Reflect Reality**: Always document the actual current state, not intended state
-   **Schema Notes**: When database schema has unused fields, note them factually
-   **Cross-Reference**: Link to other docs when appropriate, but don't duplicate content

### For AI Coding Agents

-   **Investigate Before Updating**: Use codebase search to verify current implementation
-   **Move Issues to Memory**: If you discover problems, document them in `MEMORY.md`
-   **Factual Documentation**: Describe what exists, not what should exist

# System Architecture

## Overview

The DDS Laravel system is a comprehensive document management and invoice processing platform built with Laravel 10, featuring role-based access control, file management, and integrated notification systems.

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

-   **Laravel Sanctum**: API authentication
-   **Spatie Laravel Permission**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
-   **User Roles**: superadmin, admin, user with department-based restrictions

### 2. Database Architecture

-   **Primary Database**: MySQL (`dds_backend`)
-   **Key Tables**: users, departments, invoices, suppliers, invoice_types, projects, additional_documents, additional_document_invoice (pivot), distributions
-   **Relationships**: Invoices ‚Üî Additional Documents many-to-many via `additional_document_invoice`

```mermaid
graph TD;
  "Invoice" -- "additional_document_invoice" --- "AdditionalDocument";
  "additional_document_invoice"["additional_document_invoice\n(invoice_id, additional_document_id)"]
```

#### Invoice ‚Üî Additional Documents Linking Flow

-   Users can optionally link additional documents to an invoice on Create/Edit.
-   Suggestions are discovered via PO Number: on blur of `po_no`, the UI calls `POST /invoices/search-additional-documents`.
-   The endpoint returns up to 50 matches without location restrictions (all users see all matches).
-   Users select documents via checkboxes; selections are persisted with hidden inputs `additional_document_ids[]`.
-   On save, the pivot is synchronized (`attach/sync`).
-   The Invoice show page lists linked additional documents with `cur_loc` badges.

### 3. File Management System

-   **Storage**: Laravel Storage with local filesystem
-   **File Types**: PDFs, images, documents
-   **Attachments**: Polymorphic relationships for multiple document types

## Invoices Management System

### Current Implementation Status

-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Core CRUD operations with proper validation
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Role-based access control and location restrictions
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Comprehensive toastr notification system
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: AJAX form submission for create/edit operations
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: SweetAlert2 integration for delete confirmations
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: DataTables integration with server-side processing
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Edit page navigation (dedicated edit pages instead of modals)
-   **‚úÖ Complete**: Delete functionality with proper AJAX handling and user feedback

### Technical Architecture

```
Invoices Management Flow:
1. User Access Control ‚Üí Department Location Validation
2. Form Submission ‚Üí AJAX Processing ‚Üí Database Validation
3. Real-time Validation ‚Üí Composite Unique Constraint (supplier_id + invoice_number)
4. User Feedback ‚Üí Toastr Notifications + SweetAlert2 Confirmations
5. Data Persistence ‚Üí Optimized Database Schema with Proper Indexes
```

### Validation System Architecture

#### **Invoice Number Duplication Prevention**

-   **Database Level**: Composite unique constraint on `(supplier_id, invoice_number)`

    Route::post('/validate-invoice-number', [InvoiceController::class, 'validateInvoiceNumber']);
    Route::get('/check-session', [InvoiceController::class, 'checkSession']);

    // Attachment management (corrected structure)
    Route::get('/attachments/{invoice}/show', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'show']);
    Route::get('/attachments', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'index']);
    Route::get('/attachments/data', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'data']);
