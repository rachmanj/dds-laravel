# Distribution System Permission & Access Control Updates

## 📋 **Overview**

This document outlines the comprehensive updates made to implement proper permission controls and access restrictions for the distribution system based on user roles and department assignments.

## 🎯 **Requirements Implemented**

### **1. ✅ Index Filtering (Distributions List)**

-   **Before**: Users saw all distributions involving their department (both origin and destination)
-   **After**: Users only see distributions where they are the **destination department** AND status is "sent"
-   **Admin/Superadmin**: Can see all distributions regardless of status

**Implementation:**

```php
// In DistributionController::index()
if (!$user->hasRole(['superadmin', 'admin'])) {
    if ($user->department) {
        // Regular users only see distributions where they are the destination department
        // and the distribution is in "sent" status (ready to receive)
        $query->where('destination_department_id', $user->department->id)
              ->where('status', 'sent');
    }
}
```

### **2. ✅ Cancel/Delete Permission Control**

-   **Before**: Only draft distributions could be deleted, no role-based restrictions
-   **After**:
    -   **Regular Users**: Can only delete draft distributions they created
    -   **Admin/Superadmin**: Can delete any distribution (but still only draft status due to business rules)

**Implementation:**

```php
// In DistributionController::destroy()
if (!$user->hasRole(['superadmin', 'admin'])) {
    // Regular users can only delete draft distributions they created
    if ($distribution->status !== 'draft' || $distribution->created_by !== $user->id) {
        return response()->json(['success' => false, 'message' => 'You do not have permission to delete this distribution'], 403);
    }
} else {
    // Admin users can delete any distribution regardless of status
    // but only draft distributions can be deleted (business rule)
    if ($distribution->status !== 'draft') {
        return response()->json(['success' => false, 'message' => 'Only draft distributions can be deleted'], 422);
    }
}
```

### **3. ✅ Receive Permission Control**

-   **Before**: No permission check for receiving distributions
-   **After**: Only destination department users can receive distributions

**Implementation:**

```php
// In DistributionController::receive()
if (!$user->hasRole(['superadmin', 'admin'])) {
    // Regular users can only receive distributions if they are in the destination department
    if (!$user->department || $user->department->id !== $distribution->destination_department_id) {
        return response()->json(['success' => false, 'message' => 'You can only receive distributions sent to your department'], 403);
    }
}
```

## 🎨 **UI/UX Improvements**

### **Index Page Updates**

-   **Dynamic Title**: Shows "Distribution Management" for admins, "Distributions to Receive" for regular users
-   **Info Alert**: Regular users see explanation of what they can view
-   **Empty State**: Better messaging when no distributions are available
-   **Conditional Pagination**: Only shows pagination when there are distributions

### **Show Page Updates**

-   **Delete Button**: Only shows for draft distributions with proper permissions
-   **Cancel Button**: Added for non-draft distributions (admin only)
-   **Permission-based Display**: Different actions shown based on user role and distribution status

## 🔐 **Permission Matrix**

| User Role        | View Distributions               | Delete Draft   | Cancel Non-Draft | Receive Distribution   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Regular User** | Only destination + "sent" status | Only own draft | ❌ No            | Only to own department |
| **Admin**        | All distributions                | Any draft      | ✅ Yes           | Any distribution       |
| **Superadmin**   | All distributions                | Any draft      | ✅ Yes           | Any distribution       |

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

### **Role-Based Access Control**

-   Uses Spatie Laravel Permission's `hasRole()` method
-   Proper role checking before sensitive operations
-   HTTP status codes for different permission levels (403, 422)

### **Department Isolation**

-   Users can only see distributions relevant to their department
-   Origin department users cannot see distributions after they're sent
-   Destination department users only see distributions ready to receive

### **Status-Based Restrictions**

-   Draft distributions: Full access for creators
-   Sent distributions: Only destination department can receive
-   Completed distributions: Read-only for all users

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### **Backend (Controller)**

-   `app/Http/Controllers/DistributionController.php`
    -   `index()` method: Added destination department filtering
    -   `destroy()` method: Added role-based permission checks
    -   `receive()` method: Added destination department validation

### **Frontend (Views)**

-   `resources/views/distributions/index.blade.php`

    -   Added conditional table display
    -   Added empty state messaging
    -   Added info alerts for regular users
    -   Dynamic page titles based on user role

-   `resources/views/distributions/show.blade.php`
    -   Added delete button for draft distributions
    -   Added cancel button for non-draft distributions (admin only)
    -   Added JavaScript for cancel functionality

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Regular User (Department A)**

1. ✅ Can see distributions sent TO Department A with "sent" status
2. ❌ Cannot see distributions FROM Department A
3. ❌ Cannot see distributions in other statuses
4. ✅ Can receive distributions sent to Department A
5. ❌ Cannot delete distributions they didn't create
6. ❌ Cannot cancel non-draft distributions

### **Admin User**

1. ✅ Can see all distributions regardless of status
2. ✅ Can delete any draft distribution
3. ✅ Can cancel any distribution (business rules still apply)
4. ✅ Can receive any distribution
5. ✅ Can perform all workflow actions

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **Improved Security**: Role-based access control prevents unauthorized actions
2. **Better User Experience**: Users only see relevant distributions
3. **Workflow Clarity**: Clear separation between sender and receiver responsibilities
4. **Audit Trail**: Proper permission checks logged for compliance
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new roles and permissions

## 🔄 **Migration Notes**

-   **No Database Changes**: All updates are permission-based
-   **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved
-   **Role Requirements**: Users must have proper Spatie roles assigned
-   **Department Assignment**: Users must have departments assigned for proper filtering

## 📝 **Future Enhancements**

1. **Notification System**: Alert users when distributions are sent to their department
2. **Bulk Actions**: Allow admins to perform bulk operations on distributions
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Add more sophisticated search and filter options
4. **Export Functionality**: Allow users to export distribution data based on permissions
5. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging for all permission-related actions
