# Invoice Table Sorting & Dashboard Enhancements

**Implementation Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Effort**: ~3 hours

## 📋 **Overview**

This document details the comprehensive improvements made to invoice and additional document table sorting, along with significant enhancements to the invoice dashboard including data fixes, visual redesigns, and the addition of department-specific aging analysis.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

1. **Implement age-based sorting** for Invoice and Additional Documents tables (oldest first)
2. **Fix Invoice Types Breakdown chart** data display issues
3. **Redesign age breakdown section** for better visual prominence
4. **Add department-specific aging section** to Invoice dashboard
5. **Clean up redundant sections** for better user experience

## ✅ **Completed Features**

### 1. Table Sorting by Document Age (Oldest First)

**Problem**: Tables were not sorted by document age, making it difficult for users to identify and prioritize oldest documents requiring immediate attention.

**Solution**: Implemented server-side sorting by `days_in_current_location` in descending order.

**Files Modified**:

-   `app/Http/Controllers/AdditionalDocumentController.php`
-   `app/Http/Controllers/InvoiceController.php`
-   `resources/views/invoices/index.blade.php`

**Implementation Details**:

```php
// AdditionalDocumentController.php - data() method (lines 138-143)
$documents = $query->get()->sortByDesc(function ($document) {
    $arrivalDate = $document->current_location_arrival_date;
    return $arrivalDate ? $arrivalDate->diffInDays(now()) : 0;
})->values();

// InvoiceController.php - data() method (lines 89-99)
$invoices = $query->get()->sortByDesc(function ($invoice) {
    if ($invoice->distribution_status === 'available' && !$invoice->hasBeenDistributed()) {
        $dateToUse = $invoice->receive_date;
    } else {
        $dateToUse = $invoice->current_location_arrival_date;
    }
    return $dateToUse ? $dateToUse->diffInDays(now()) : 0;
})->values();

// invoices/index.blade.php - DataTable configuration (line 557)
order: [],  // Disable client-side sorting to preserve server-side order
```

**Key Points**:

-   Uses model accessor `current_location_arrival_date` for accurate department-specific aging
-   For available documents: uses `receive_date` or `created_at`
-   For distributed documents: uses `received_at` from most recent verified distribution
-   DataTable client-side sorting disabled to preserve server-side order
-   Consistent implementation across both Additional Documents and Invoices

**Result**:

-   Oldest documents now appear first in tables
-   Example: `TEST-ZERO-001` invoice with 276 days now in first row
-   Users can immediately identify documents requiring urgent attention

---

### 2. Invoice Types Breakdown Chart Fix

**Problem**: Invoice Types Breakdown chart was not displaying any data on the dashboard.

**Root Causes**:

1. Controller was using `$type->name` but InvoiceType model only has `type_name` field
2. View was using `@push('scripts')` but layout expected `@stack('js')`

**Solution**:

-   Fixed controller to use correct field name
-   Fixed view to use correct stack directive

**Files Modified**:

-   `app/Http/Controllers/InvoiceDashboardController.php` (line 288)
-   `resources/views/invoices/dashboard.blade.php` (line 386)

**Implementation Details**:

```php
// Before (incorrect):
$breakdown[$type->name] = [
    'count' => $count,
    'amount' => $amount
];

// After (correct):
$breakdown[$type->type_name] = [
    'count' => $count,
    'amount' => $amount
];
```

```blade
{{-- Before (incorrect): --}}
@push('scripts')

{{-- After (correct): --}}
@push('js')
```

**Result**:

-   Chart now displays correctly with all 7 invoice types
-   Current data: Item (28), Others (18), Ekspedisi (3), Service (2), Rental (1), Catering (0), Consultans (0)
-   Chart.js loads properly and renders doughnut chart

---

### 3. Invoice Age Breakdown Redesign

**Problem**: Original age breakdown section was not visually prominent enough to draw user attention to aged invoices.

**Solution**: Redesigned with modern gradient cards, animations, and better visual hierarchy.

**Note**: This section was later removed to avoid duplication with the more comprehensive "Invoice Age in Current Department" section.

**Features Implemented** (before removal):

-   Gradient background cards with smooth color transitions
-   Large, bold numbers (3rem font size)
-   Priority-based animations (pulsing for high-priority items)
-   Rotating gradient background effect
-   Blinking "Review Now" badges
-   Progress bar showing age distribution percentages

---

### 4. Invoice Age in Current Department Section

**Problem**: Invoice dashboard lacked department-specific aging analysis similar to Additional Documents dashboard.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive "Invoice Age in Current Department" section with age cards, status breakdown table, and interactive filtering.

**Files Modified**:

-   `app/Http/Controllers/InvoiceDashboardController.php` (added method at lines 343-380)
-   `resources/views/invoices/dashboard.blade.php` (added section at lines 514-635)

**Implementation Details**:

```php
// InvoiceDashboardController.php - getInvoiceAgeAndStatusMetrics() method
private function getInvoiceAgeAndStatusMetrics($user, $userLocationCode, $isAdmin)
{
    $query = Invoice::query();

    if (!$isAdmin && $userLocationCode) {
        $query->where('cur_loc', $userLocationCode);
    }

    $invoices = (clone $query)->get();

    $ageBreakdown = [
        '0-7_days' => 0,
        '8-14_days' => 0,
        '15-30_days' => 0,
        '30_plus_days' => 0
    ];

    $statusByAge = [
        '0-7_days' => ['available' => 0, 'in_transit' => 0, 'distributed' => 0, 'unaccounted_for' => 0],
        '8-14_days' => ['available' => 0, 'in_transit' => 0, 'distributed' => 0, 'unaccounted_for' => 0],
        '15-30_days' => ['available' => 0, 'in_transit' => 0, 'distributed' => 0, 'unaccounted_for' => 0],
        '30_plus_days' => ['available' => 0, 'in_transit' => 0, 'distributed' => 0, 'unaccounted_for' => 0]
    ];

    foreach ($invoices as $invoice) {
        $ageCategory = $invoice->current_location_age_category;
        $status = $invoice->distribution_status;

        $ageBreakdown[$ageCategory]++;
        $statusByAge[$ageCategory][$status]++;
    }

    return [
        'age_breakdown' => $ageBreakdown,
        'status_by_age' => $statusByAge
    ];
}
```

**Features**:

1. **Age Category Cards** (4 cards):

    - 0-7 days (Green) - Recent invoices
    - 8-14 days (Orange) - Needs attention
    - 15-30 days (Cyan) - Moderate age
    - 30+ days (Red) - Urgent action required

2. **Each Card Contains**:

    - Color-coded icon (check, clock, calendar, exclamation-triangle)
    - Large count number
    - Progress bar showing percentage of total
    - "View Invoices" action button (when count > 0)
    - "URGENT" badge for 30+ days

3. **Status Breakdown by Age Table**:

    - Shows distribution status for each age group
    - Columns: Age Group, Available, In Transit, Distributed, Unaccounted, Actions
    - Clickable badges to filter by age + status
    - "CRITICAL" badge for 30+ days row
    - Red background highlighting for critical rows
    - Action buttons with eye icons

4. **"How Aging is Calculated" Info Box**:
    - Explains that aging is based on arrival at current department
    - Clarifies difference from original creation date
    - Helps users understand the aging methodology

**Current Data** (as of 2025-10-08):

-   **0-7 days**: 47 invoices (90.4%) - All available
-   **8-14 days**: 4 invoices (7.7%) - All available
-   **15-30 days**: 0 invoices
-   **30+ days**: 1 invoice (1.9%) - Available - **CRITICAL**

The 30+ days invoice is `TEST-ZERO-001` with 276 days in current location.

---

### 5. Dashboard Cleanup

**Problem**: After adding comprehensive "Invoice Age in Current Department" section, the old age breakdown within Distribution Status card became redundant.

**Solution**: Removed old age breakdown section and associated CSS styles.

**Files Modified**:

-   `resources/views/invoices/dashboard.blade.php` (removed lines with gradient cards and related CSS)

**Result**:

-   Cleaner dashboard layout
-   No duplication of information
-   Single, comprehensive age analysis section
-   Improved user experience with focused information

---

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### Model Accessors (Invoice & AdditionalDocument Models)

#### `current_location_arrival_date`

Determines when the document arrived at its current department location.

**Logic**:

```php
public function getCurrentLocationArrivalDateAttribute()
{
    // If document has never been distributed, use original receive_date
    if ($this->distribution_status === 'available' && !$this->hasBeenDistributed()) {
        return $this->receive_date ?: $this->created_at;
    }

    // Find the most recent distribution where this document was received
    $lastDistribution = $this->distributions()
        ->whereHas('documents', function ($query) {
            $query->where('document_id', $this->id)
                ->where('document_type', Invoice::class)
                ->where('receiver_verification_status', 'verified');
        })
        ->whereNotNull('received_at')
        ->orderBy('received_at', 'desc')
        ->first();

    if ($lastDistribution) {
        return $lastDistribution->received_at;
    }

    // Fallback to original receive_date
    return $this->receive_date ?: $this->created_at;
}
```

#### `days_in_current_location`

Calculates the number of days since arrival at current department.

**Logic**:

```php
public function getDaysInCurrentLocationAttribute()
{
    $arrivalDate = $this->current_location_arrival_date;
    return $arrivalDate ? $arrivalDate->diffInDays(now()) : 0;
}
```

#### `current_location_age_category`

Categorizes the age into one of four groups.

**Logic**:

```php
public function getCurrentLocationAgeCategoryAttribute()
{
    $days = $this->days_in_current_location;

    if ($days <= 7) {
        return '0-7_days';
    } elseif ($days <= 14) {
        return '8-14_days';
    } elseif ($days <= 30) {
        return '15-30_days';
    } else {
        return '30_plus_days';
    }
}
```

### Controller Methods

#### Sorting Logic (InvoiceController & AdditionalDocumentController)

```php
// Get documents/invoices and sort by days in current location (oldest first)
$items = $query->get()->sortByDesc(function ($item) {
    // For available items that haven't been distributed, use receive_date
    if ($item->distribution_status === 'available' && !$item->hasBeenDistributed()) {
        $dateToUse = $item->receive_date;
    } else {
        // For distributed items, use the model's current_location_arrival_date
        $dateToUse = $item->current_location_arrival_date;
    }
    return $dateToUse ? $dateToUse->diffInDays(now()) : 0;
})->values();
```

#### Age Metrics Calculation (InvoiceDashboardController)

```php
private function getInvoiceAgeAndStatusMetrics($user, $userLocationCode, $isAdmin)
{
    $query = Invoice::query();

    if (!$isAdmin && $userLocationCode) {
        $query->where('cur_loc', $userLocationCode);
    }

    $invoices = (clone $query)->get();

    // Initialize age breakdown structure
    $ageBreakdown = [
        '0-7_days' => 0,
        '8-14_days' => 0,
        '15-30_days' => 0,
        '30_plus_days' => 0
    ];

    // Initialize status by age structure
    $statusByAge = [
        '0-7_days' => ['available' => 0, 'in_transit' => 0, 'distributed' => 0, 'unaccounted_for' => 0],
        '8-14_days' => ['available' => 0, 'in_transit' => 0, 'distributed' => 0, 'unaccounted_for' => 0],
        '15-30_days' => ['available' => 0, 'in_transit' => 0, 'distributed' => 0, 'unaccounted_for' => 0],
        '30_plus_days' => ['available' => 0, 'in_transit' => 0, 'distributed' => 0, 'unaccounted_for' => 0]
    ];

    // Calculate metrics using model accessors
    foreach ($invoices as $invoice) {
        $ageCategory = $invoice->current_location_age_category;
        $status = $invoice->distribution_status;

        $ageBreakdown[$ageCategory]++;
        $statusByAge[$ageCategory][$status]++;
    }

    return [
        'age_breakdown' => $ageBreakdown,
        'status_by_age' => $statusByAge
    ];
}
```

### View Components

#### Age Category Cards

```blade
@foreach ($invoiceAgeAndStatus['age_breakdown'] ?? [] as $age => $count)
    <div class="col-md-3 mb-3">
        <div class="info-box {{ $count > 0 && $age === '30_plus_days' ? 'bg-danger' : 'bg-light' }}">

---

## 📝 **Key Learnings**

1. **DataTable Sorting Override**: Client-side DataTable sorting can override server-side sorting. Solution: Set `order: []` to disable default sorting.

2. **Model Field Names**: Always verify actual database field names. InvoiceType uses `type_name`, not `name`.

3. **Blade Stack Directives**: Layout uses `@stack('js')`, so views must use `@push('js')`, not `@push('scripts')`.

4. **Department-Specific Aging**: Using `current_location_arrival_date` provides more accurate aging than `created_at` for workflow tracking.

5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Animations and color coding significantly improve user attention to critical items.

6. **Redundancy Removal**: Having multiple similar sections causes confusion. Keep one comprehensive section instead.

---

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

### Potential Improvements

1. **Age-Based Notifications**: Send email/SMS alerts when invoices reach 30+ days
2. **Automated Distribution**: Auto-distribute invoices that have been available for too long
3. **Aging Trends**: Add historical trending to show if aging is improving or worsening
4. **Department Comparison**: Compare aging metrics across different departments
5. **Custom Age Thresholds**: Allow departments to set their own age category thresholds
6. **Bulk Actions**: Add bulk distribution/processing for aged invoices
7. **Export Aged Invoices**: Export lists of invoices by age category
