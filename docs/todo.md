    -   Drop existing foreign key constraint
    -   Make `distribution_id` nullable
    -   Re-add foreign key constraint with nullable support

**Controller Fixes Applied**:

```php
// BEFORE (BROKEN): Missing required action_type field
DistributionHistory::create([
    'distribution_id' => null,
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'action' => 'status_reset',
    // ❌ Missing 'action_type' field
    'metadata' => [...],
    'action_performed_at' => now()
]);

// AFTER (FIXED): Complete required fields
DistributionHistory::create([
    'distribution_id' => null,
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'action' => 'status_reset',
    'action_type' => 'status_management', // ✅ Added required field
