## üéØ **Recent Decisions (2025-08-21)**

### **1. Dashboard Error Prevention Strategy**

#### **Decision**: Implement comprehensive safe array access and defensive programming for all dashboard views

**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Impact**: High - Dashboard reliability and user experience

**Context**: Multiple dashboards were experiencing "Undefined array key" errors due to missing data or incorrect column references, causing crashes and poor user experience.

**Options Considered**:

1. **Fix Individual Errors**: Address each error as it occurs
2. **Comprehensive Safe Access**: Implement `??` fallbacks throughout all views
3. **Data Validation**: Add validation in controllers before passing data to views
4. **Error Handling**: Catch and handle errors gracefully in views

**Chosen Solution**: Comprehensive safe array access with defensive programming
