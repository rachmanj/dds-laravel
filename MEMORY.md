### 2025-10-11 — Distribution Print Views: Separate Optimized Templates for Invoice & Additional Documents

-   **Feature**: Refactored distribution print views into separate optimized templates for invoices and additional documents
-   **Scope**: Distribution print/transmittal advice pages
-   **Implementation Date**: 2025-10-11
-   **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & TESTED**

#### **Rationale**

The original single print template tried to accommodate both invoice and additional document distributions using the same table structure, resulting in:

-   **Wasted columns**: AMOUNT column for additional documents always showed "N/A"
-   **Missing relevant fields**: Additional documents lacked RECEIVE DATE and CURRENT LOCATION
-   **Semantic mismatch**: VENDOR/SUPPLIER meant different things for each type
-   **Cluttered display**: Not optimized for either document type

#### **Solution: Separate Print Templates**

Created two specialized print views, each optimized for its specific document type:

#### **1. Invoice Transmittal Advice** (`print-invoice.blade.php`)

**Document Title:** "Invoice Transmittal Advice"

**Optimized Columns:**
| NO | INVOICE TYPE | SUPPLIER | INVOICE NO. | INVOICE DATE | AMOUNT | PO NO | PROJECT |

**Features:**

-   Shows invoice type (Item, Others, etc.)
-   Displays supplier name from relationship
-   **Keeps AMOUNT column** (critical for invoices)
-   Attached additional documents shown in compact single-line format below each invoice
-   Format: "Attached: Goods Receipt - 252450408 (02-Sep-2025) - PO: 250206312"

**Example Data:**
| NO | INVOICE TYPE | SUPPLIER | INVOICE NO. | INVOICE DATE | AMOUNT | PO NO | PROJECT |
|----|--------------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Item** | MULTITECH PRIMA UTAMA | 32509444 | 02-Sep-2025 | **IDR 6,674,430** | 250206312 | 022C |
| | _Attached: Goods Receipt - 252450408 (02-Sep-2025) - PO: 250206312_ | | | | | |
| 2 | **Others** | PRATASABA | 25800309 | 25-Sep-2025 | **IDR 7,561,903** | N/A | 000H |

#### **2. Document Transmittal Advice** (`print-additional-document.blade.php`)

**Document Title:** "Document Transmittal Advice"

**Optimized Columns:**
| NO. | DOC NO. | DOC DATE | DOC TYPE | PO NO | INV NO | PROJECT |

**Features:**

-   Shows specific document type (Delivery Order, Goods Receipt, Material Issue, ITO, etc.)
-   **Removed AMOUNT column** (always N/A for additional documents)
-   **Added INV NO column** (shows related invoice numbers from belongsToMany relationship)
-   **Simplified layout** with 7 focused columns
-   **NO. column right-aligned** for better readability
-   **Removed** RECEIVE DATE, VENDOR CODE, CUR LOC for cleaner, more focused print

**Example Data:**
| NO. | DOC NO. | DOC DATE | DOC TYPE | PO NO | INV NO | PROJECT |
|-----|---------|----------|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **P.643/CSA/25/250206314** | 03-Oct-2025 | Delivery Order (DO) | 250206314 | **-** | 017C |
| 2 | **JKT-DO-25-10-00011** | 06-Oct-2025 | Delivery Order (DO) | 250206240 | **-** | 022C |

#### **Changes Made**

1. **Created** `resources/views/distributions/print-invoice.blade.php` (400+ lines)

    - Invoice-specific title: "Invoice Transmittal Advice"
    - Optimized table: 8 columns focused on invoice data
    - Compact attached document display (single line)
    - Keeps critical AMOUNT column

2. **Created** `resources/views/distributions/print-additional-document.blade.php` (400+ lines)

    - Document-specific title: "Document Transmittal Advice"
    - Optimized table: 7 columns focused on essential document info
    - Removed AMOUNT column (always N/A)
    - Added INV NO column (shows related invoice numbers)
    - Right-aligned NO. column for better readability

3. **Updated** `app/Http/Controllers/DistributionController.php` (lines 304-324)

    - Modified `print()` method to route to appropriate view based on `document_type`
    - Added invoice relationship loading for additional documents
    - Invoice distributions → `print-invoice.blade.php`
    - Additional document distributions → `print-additional-document.blade.php`

4. **Kept** `resources/views/distributions/print.blade.php` (485 lines)
    - Maintained as fallback for backward compatibility
    - Can be deprecated in future if not needed

#### **Comparison**

**Before (Single Template):**

-   Same columns for all types: NO | DOCUMENT TYPE | VENDOR/SUPPLIER | DOCUMENT NO. | DATE | AMOUNT | PO NO | PROJECT
-   Additional documents wasted AMOUNT column (always N/A)
-   Missing important fields for additional documents (RECEIVE DATE, CUR LOC)

**After (Separate Templates):**

**Invoice Print:**

-   Focused on invoices: NO | INVOICE TYPE | SUPPLIER | INVOICE NO. | INVOICE DATE | **AMOUNT** | PO NO | PROJECT
-   Attached documents in compact format

**Additional Document Print:**

-   Focused and simplified: NO. (right) | DOC NO. | DOC DATE | DOC TYPE | PO NO | **INV NO** | PROJECT
-   No wasted columns
-   Shows related invoice numbers
-   Clean, essential information only

#### **Benefits**

✅ **Space Efficiency** - No wasted columns, all fields relevant

-   All 38 total documents (invoices + attached docs) display correctly

✅ **Additional Document Distribution #9** (print-additional-document.blade.php):

-   Title: "Document Transmittal Advice"
-   36 Delivery Order documents
-   7 focused columns: NO. (right-aligned), DOC NO., DOC DATE, DOC TYPE, PO NO, INV NO, PROJECT
-   INV NO column shows related invoice numbers (currently "-" for documents without invoices)
-   No wasted columns - all fields are relevant
-   Clean, simplified layout optimized for essential information

#### **Files Created/Modified**

1. **Created** `resources/views/distributions/print-invoice.blade.php`

### 2025-10-11 — Distribution Print View: Fixed Column Mismatch in Transmittal Advice

-   **Feature**: Fixed column alignment mismatch in distribution print/transmittal advice tables
-   **Scope**: Distribution print view - invoice and additional document tables
-   **Implementation Date**: 2025-10-11
-   **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & TESTED**

#### **Issue Found**

The Transmittal Advice print page had misaligned columns where document type information was appearing in the wrong column:

**Before (Incorrect):**

-   DOCUMENT TYPE column was showing: "Additional Document" (generic category)
-   VENDOR/SUPPLIER column was showing: "Delivery Order (DO)" (should be in DOCUMENT TYPE!)

**Root Cause:** The additional-document-table.blade.php partial was displaying:

-   Column 2: Generic "Additional Document" text instead of specific type
-   Column 3: Document type name instead of vendor/supplier

#### **Changes Made**

1. **File**: `resources/views/distributions/partials/additional-document-table.blade.php`

    - **Line 26**: Changed from hardcoded "Additional Document" to `{{ $additionalDoc->type->type_name }}` to show actual document type
    - **Line 27**: Changed from `{{ $additionalDoc->type->type_name }}` to `{{ $additionalDoc->vendor_code ?? '-' }}` to show vendor code

2. **File**: `resources/views/distributions/partials/invoice-table.blade.php`
    - **Line 48**: Wrapped type name in `<em>` tag for attached additional documents
    - **Line 49**: Added vendor_code display for attached additional documents (was empty)

#### **After (Correct):**

**Additional Document Table:**
| NO | DOCUMENT TYPE | VENDOR/SUPPLIER | DOCUMENT NO. | DATE | AMOUNT | PO NO | PROJECT |
|----|---------------|-----------------|--------------|------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Delivery Order (DO)** | **-** | P.643/CSA/25/250206314 | 03-Oct-2025 | N/A | 250206314 | 017C |
| 2 | **Delivery Order (DO)** | **-** | JKT-DO-25-10-00011 | 06-Oct-2025 | N/A | 250206240 | 022C |

**Invoice Table:**
| NO | DOCUMENT TYPE | VENDOR/SUPPLIER | DOCUMENT NO. | DATE | AMOUNT | PO NO | PROJECT |
|----|---------------|-----------------|--------------|------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Invoice** | **MULTITECH PRIMA UTAMA** | 32509444 | 02-Sep-2025 | IDR 6,674,430 | 250206312 | 022C |
| | _Goods Receipt_ | **-** | 252450408 | 02-Sep-2025 | | 250206312 | 022C |
| | _Delivery Order (DO)_ | **-** | 22509411 | 02-Sep-2025 | | 250206312 | 000H |

#### **Testing**

✅ **Distribution #9** (Additional Documents - 36 documents):

-   All Delivery Order rows show correct document type in DOCUMENT TYPE column
-   VENDOR/SUPPLIER column shows "-" (no vendor codes in this distribution)
-   All columns properly aligned with headers

✅ **Distribution #12** (Invoices - 38 documents):

-   Invoice rows show "Invoice" in DOCUMENT TYPE, supplier name in VENDOR/SUPPLIER
-   Attached additional documents show specific types (Goods Receipt, Material Issue, etc.)
-   Attached additional documents show "-" in VENDOR/SUPPLIER column
-   Mixed document types display correctly

#### **Files Modified**

1. `resources/views/distributions/partials/additional-document-table.blade.php` (lines 26-27)
2. `resources/views/distributions/partials/invoice-table.blade.php` (lines 48-49)

### 2025-10-11 — Additional Documents Index Enhancement: Invoice Column & Column Reordering

-   **Feature**: Added "Inv No" column and reordered columns in Additional Documents index page
-   **Scope**: Additional Documents index page table structure
-   **Implementation Date**: 2025-10-11
-   **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & TESTED**

#### **Feature Overview**

Enhanced the Additional Documents index page by adding a new "Inv No" column that displays which invoices an additional document is linked to (belongs to many relationship), and reordered all columns for better workflow and data organization.

#### **Changes Made**

1. **Backend** (`app/Http/Controllers/AdditionalDocumentController.php`):

    - Added `'invoices'` to the eager loading in the `data()` method
    - Created `invoice_numbers` column in DataTables response that:
        - Loads linked invoice numbers from the belongsToMany relationship
        - Displays comma-separated invoice numbers if multiple invoices are linked
        - Shows "-" if no invoices are linked
    - Added to `rawColumns` array for HTML rendering

2. **Frontend** (`resources/views/additional_documents/index.blade.php`):
    - **Updated table header** with new column order and names
    - **Removed "Status" column** (not in new requirements)
    - **Added "Inv No" column** header
    - **Updated DataTable configuration** with reordered columns
    - **Adjusted sort order** from column index 10 to 9 (Days column)
    - **Changed date format** to "DD-MMM-YY" for compact display

#### **New Column Order**

**Before:** No | Document Number | PO No | Vendor Code | Type | Document Date | Receive Date | Current Location | Status | Days | Actions

**After:** No | Doc No | DocDate | Type | PO No | VendorCode | **Inv No** | RecDate | CurLoc | Days | Action

| **No** | **Doc No**         | **DocDate** | **Type**            | **PO No** | **VendorCode** | **Inv No**            | **RecDate** | **CurLoc** | **Days** | **Action** |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------- | --------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1      | 251031703          | 28-Sep-25   | ITO                 | -         | -              | -                     | 28-Sep-25   | 000HACC    | 13.2     | Actions    |
| 2      | DL029528           | 24-Sep-25   | Delivery Order (DO) | 250206242 | -              | **JL033268**          | -           | 000HACC    | 0        | Actions    |
| 7      | SJ20903/TAJ/BPP/25 | 29-Sep-25   | Delivery Order (DO) | 250206147 | -              | **59211/INV/IX/2025** | -           | 000HACC    | 1.0      | Actions    |

#### **Benefits**

✅ **Quick Invoice Identification** - See which invoices are linked to additional documents at a glance  
✅ **Better Column Order** - More logical flow matching business workflow  
✅ **Compact Date Format** - More space-efficient display  
✅ **Removed Clutter** - Removed unused "Status" column  
✅ **Multiple Invoice Support** - Displays comma-separated invoice numbers for documents linked to multiple invoices

#### **Testing**

✅ **Additional Documents Index Page** (http://localhost:8000/additional-documents):

-   Table displays with correct 11-column structure
-   "Inv No" column shows linked invoice numbers correctly
-   Documents with invoices display invoice numbers (JL033268, JL033665, 59211/INV/IX/2025, etc.)
-   Documents without invoices display "-"
-   Column order matches requirements exactly
-   Sorting and pagination work correctly
-   Compact date format displays properly

#### **Technical Details**

**Relationship:** Additional documents can belong to many invoices through the `additional_document_invoice` pivot table. The new column displays all related invoice numbers for each additional document.

**Data Loading:** Backend uses eager loading (`with(['invoices'])`) to prevent N+1 query issues when loading invoice data for multiple documents.

#### **Files Modified**

1. `app/Http/Controllers/AdditionalDocumentController.php` (lines 46, 169-175, 191)
    - Added invoices eager loading
    - Added invoice_numbers column to DataTables
2. `resources/views/additional_documents/index.blade.php` (lines 216-230, 542-630)
    - Updated table headers
    - Reordered and updated DataTable columns configuration

### 2025-10-11 — Distribution View Enhancement: Supplier Column Restructuring

-   **Feature**: Restructured Distributed Documents table to show supplier in dedicated column
-   **Scope**: Distribution show page - Distributed Documents section
-   **Implementation Date**: 2025-10-11
-   **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & TESTED**

#### **Feature Overview**

Restructured the "Distributed Documents" table to use a cleaner, more organized layout by moving supplier information from the Document column to a new dedicated Supplier column. This provides better data separation, improved scannability, and makes it easier to compare suppliers across multiple documents.

#### **Changes Made**

1. **Backend** (`app/Http/Controllers/DistributionController.php` - lines 264-285):

    - Conditionally loads supplier relationship only for Invoice documents
    - Uses foreach loop to avoid relationship errors on AdditionalDocument models
    - Maintains N+1 query prevention for invoice suppliers

2. **Frontend** (`resources/views/distributions/show.blade.php`):
    - **Added new "Supplier" column** header between "Document" and "Type" columns
    - **Updated table header** with 6 columns (was 5): Document | **Supplier** | Type | Sender Status | Receiver Status | Overall Status
    - **Adjusted column widths**: Document (20%), Supplier (15%), Type (13%), Sender Status (17%), Receiver Status (17%), Overall Status (18%)
    - **Invoice rows**: Moved supplier display from Document column to new Supplier column, showing "🏢 Supplier Name"
    - **Additional Document rows**: Show dash ("-") in Supplier column since they don't have suppliers
    - **Attached document rows**: Also show dash ("-") in Supplier column
    - **Updated empty state**: Changed colspan from 5 to 6 to match new column count

#### **New Table Structure**

| **DOCUMENT**                                    | **SUPPLIER**        | **TYPE**            | **SENDER STATUS** | **RECEIVER STATUS** | **OVERALL STATUS** |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| 4978243000050202510<br>Others<br>📅 01 Oct 2025 | 🏢 TELKOM INDONESIA | Invoice             | Verified          | Pending             | Sender Verified    |
| 250352346<br>Material Issue                     | -                   | Additional Document | Verified          | Pending             | Sender Verified    |

**Benefits:**

-   More structured and scannable layout
-   Easier to compare suppliers across documents
-   Cleaner separation of document info vs supplier info
-   Better data alignment and visual hierarchy

#### **Testing**

**Test 1 - Single Document Distribution (25/000HACC/DDS/0001):**

-   ✅ Table displays with 6 columns including new Supplier column
-   ✅ Invoice shows supplier "TELKOM INDONESIA" in dedicated column
-   ✅ Document column now cleaner with just number, type, and date
-   ✅ Layout is well-balanced and professional

**Test 2 - Multi-Document Distribution (25/000HACC/DDS/0003 - 38 documents):**

-   ✅ Mixed document types handled correctly
-   ✅ Invoices (MULTITECH PRIMA UTAMA) display supplier name in Supplier column
-   ✅ Additional documents (Goods Receipt, Material Issue, Delivery Orders) display "-" in Supplier column
-   ✅ No performance issues with 38 documents
-   ✅ Table remains readable and well-organized

#### **Implementation Notes**

**Issue Resolved**: Initial implementation attempted to eager load `documents.document.supplier` for all documents, causing 500 error for distributions with Additional Documents (which don't have supplier relationship). Fixed by conditionally loading supplier only for Invoice documents using a foreach loop.

#### **Files Modified**

1. `app/Http/Controllers/DistributionController.php` (lines 264-285)
2. `resources/views/distributions/show.blade.php` (lines 516-840)

2. **Excel Date Parsing**: Supports Excel serial numbers (45915 → 2025-09-10) and multiple date formats
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Prevents re-importing existing documents with clear messaging
4. **Separate Pages**: ITO Import and General Import on distinct pages for better UX
5. **Informative Feedback**: Comprehensive import summary with success/skip/error counts and document type breakdown
6. **Permission-Based Access**: Sidebar menu and buttons respect user permissions
7. **Template Download**: Provides Excel template with sample data and styling

#### **Technical Implementation**

**New Components:**

-   `app/Imports/GeneralDocumentImport.php` - Main import processing logic (450 lines)
-   `app/Exports/GeneralDocumentTemplate.php` - Template generation (80 lines)
-   `resources/views/additional_documents/import-general.blade.php` - General import page (400 lines)
-   Migrations for permissions: `import-general-documents` (logistic, accounting roles)

**Modified Components:**

-   `AdditionalDocumentController.php` - Added importGeneral(), processGeneralImport(), downloadGeneralTemplate()
-   `routes/additional-docs.php` - Added 3 new routes with permission middleware
-   `import.blade.php` - Converted from tabs to standalone ITO import page with permission checks
-   `sidebar.blade.php` - Added permission checks for Import Documents menu item

**Routes:**

-   GET `/additional-documents/import-general` - Display general import page
-   POST `/additional-documents/process-general-import` - Process upload
-   GET `/additional-documents/download-general-template` - Download template

#### **Excel Structure**

```
| description | do_no | do_date | gr_no | gr_date | mr_no | mr_date |
