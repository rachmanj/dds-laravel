### [028] Invoice Number Duplication Prevention System (2025-08-10) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge/Decision**: Implemented comprehensive invoice number duplication prevention system that prevents duplicate invoice numbers within the same supplier while allowing different suppliers to use the same invoice numbers. This addresses a common business requirement where suppliers have their own invoice numbering systems.

**Solution**: Built a three-layer validation system:

1. **Database Level**: Composite unique constraint on `(supplier_id, invoice_number)` in the invoices table
2. **Application Level**: Custom validation rule `UniqueInvoicePerSupplier` with proper error handling
3. **Frontend Level**: Real-time AJAX validation with debounced input (500ms delay) for instant user feedback

**Key Learning**: Multi-layer validation systems provide the best balance of data integrity, user experience, and business logic compliance. Database constraints prevent race conditions, application rules handle business logic, and frontend validation provides immediate feedback. The composite unique constraint approach is more flexible than simple unique constraints and better matches real-world business requirements.

**Technical Implementation**:

-   Modified existing invoices table migration to add composite constraint instead of simple unique
-   Created custom validation rule in `app/Rules/UniqueInvoicePerSupplier.php`
-   Added AJAX endpoint `/invoices/validate-invoice-number` for real-time validation
-   Enhanced both create and edit forms with instant feedback
-   Used debouncing to optimize API calls and improve performance

**Outcome**: System now correctly prevents invoice number duplication per supplier while maintaining excellent user experience. Users get immediate feedback when entering duplicate invoice numbers, and the database maintains data integrity at the constraint level.

### [027] Comprehensive Invoice Management System Enhancement (2025-08-10) ✅ COMPLETE

**Key Learning**: Dedicated edit pages provide better UX consistency and easier maintenance than complex modal systems. Comprehensive notification systems (toastr + SweetAlert2) ensure users always receive proper feedback for their actions, creating a more professional and user-friendly experience.

### [026] Invoices Edit Flow and Delete Action Fix (2025-08-10) ✅ COMPLETE

**Challenge/Decision**: Edit from invoices list incorrectly opened a modal; requirement is to navigate to `edit` page. Delete button wasn’t working with DataTables-rendered rows.

**Solution**: Server-side actions now link to `invoices.edit`; removed edit modal and JS from index view. Implemented delegated delete handler on `#invoices-table` using SweetAlert2 confirmation and AJAX `DELETE`, reloading the table without resetting pagination.

**Key Learning**: With DataTables’ dynamic DOM, bind actions using delegated events. Prefer single edit page to avoid duplicated form logic and validation across modal + page.

### [023] Invoice Edit Page Auto-Thousand Separation Implementation (2025-08-10) ✅ COMPLETE

**Issue**: Invoice edit page amount input field lacked auto-thousand separation functionality, making it difficult for users to input large monetary values with proper formatting and validation.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Input Field Structure**: Changed amount input from single `type="number"` to dual input system with visible `amount_display` (text) and hidden `amount` (numeric value)
2. **Auto-Thousand Separation**: Implemented JavaScript input handler that automatically formats numbers with thousand separators using Indonesian locale (`id-ID`)
3. **Value Synchronization**: Added logic to sync formatted display value with hidden numeric value for form submission
4. **Existing Value Formatting**: Added page load logic to format existing invoice amount values with thousand separators
5. **Fallback Handling**: Implemented fallback to display invoice amount if no old input value exists

**Files Modified**:

-   `resources/views/invoices/edit.blade.php` - Amount input field and JavaScript functionality

**Result**: Invoice edit page now provides user-friendly amount input with automatic thousand separation, consistent with the create page implementation, improving data entry experience and reducing input errors.

### [024] Invoice Amount Input Field Standardization with formatNumber Function (2025-08-10) ✅ COMPLETE

**Issue**: User requested implementation of a specific `formatNumber` JavaScript function for auto-thousand separation on amount input fields, replacing the previous dual-input system implementation.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Create Page Updates**:

    - Replaced dual input system (amount_display + hidden amount) with single input field
    - Added `onkeyup="formatNumber(this)"` attribute to amount input
    - Implemented `formatNumber` function that handles decimal points and thousand separators
    - Updated page load logic to use `formatNumber` function for existing values

2. **Edit Page Updates**:

    - Replaced dual input system with single input field
    - Added `onkeyup="formatNumber(this)"` attribute to amount input
    - Implemented same `formatNumber` function for consistency
    - Updated page load logic to use `formatNumber` function for both old input and invoice values

3. **formatNumber Function Features**:

    - Removes non-digit characters except dots
    - Ensures only one decimal point
    - Adds thousand separators using comma
    - Preserves decimal precision
    - Handles edge cases for multiple decimal points

4. **JavaScript Scope Fix**:

    - Moved `formatNumber` function definition to `@section('styles')` to ensure it's available when HTML is parsed
    - This resolves the "Uncaught ReferenceError: formatNumber is not defined" error
    - Function is now defined in the head section before the input fields are rendered

5. **Validation Error Fix**:

    - Implemented dual-input system: `amount_display` (visible with commas) and `amount` (hidden, clean numeric)
    - `formatNumber` function updates both fields simultaneously
    - Form submission uses the clean `amount` field without commas
    - Resolves "The amount field must be a number" validation error

**Files Modified**:

-   `resources/views/invoices/create.blade.php` - Amount input field and JavaScript functionality
-   `resources/views/invoices/edit.blade.php` - Amount input field and JavaScript functionality

**Result**: Both invoice create and edit pages now use the standardized `formatNumber` function for auto-thousand separation, providing consistent user experience and improved data entry functionality across the invoice management system. The JavaScript function is properly scoped and available when needed. The dual-input system ensures proper validation while maintaining user-friendly display formatting.
